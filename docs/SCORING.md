All points aggregated in a simple text file by name

- 1 point for externalizetion of each string into constant
- 3 points for each of 1st 3 enums created and called
- 6 points for first i18 usage in any game (per user)
- 4 points for externalization of environment variables from gitignore local source
- inverse score for 10 minutes or less or more?
