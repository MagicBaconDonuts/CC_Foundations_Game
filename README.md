# CC_Foundations_Game
experiment with CC foundations

This exercise is designed to create reps in the areas necessary for basic CC workflow

- java coding basics
- TDD
- tickets or whatever it is that you call agile issues/tasks/whatever
- pull requests and branches as workflow
- working as a team especially sharing screens while you work
- naming conventions and standards as implicit workflow rules
- teamwork and velocity as mutually interdependent

The basic idea is that you cannot play this game without learning the basics of CC workflow as a side effect.
